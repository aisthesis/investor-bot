lib/getdata
===
Code for retrieving and cleaning data. The data files
produced are still "source data" for multiple predictors and
investors.

NOTE: For the Octave scripts here to work properly, Octave must
be ''started'' in this directory so that the code in .octaverc
can define paths to dependencies and data directories.
