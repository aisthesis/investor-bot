Portfolio baseline
---
A comparison needs to be made to the following investment strategy:

Distribute funds evenly among all stocks in the portfolio, maintaining some percentage
as cash. Sell stock evenly to expand portfolio (some stocks are not included initially
due to lack of data). This will presumably give a baseline higher than the S&P as a whole.
