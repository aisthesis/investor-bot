Acquire protobuf from https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/detail?name=protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz&can=2&q=
Or run getprotobuf here which will wget it for you.

After download, untar it, cd into its new subdirectory, and at a minimum execute the following:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install

Note that make install may require sudo.

This will install the C++ goodies and compiler and should unblock your build.

For complete information, see the README you just untarred.
