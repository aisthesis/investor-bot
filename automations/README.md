automations
===
Automate investments using a specific recommender,
investor, etc.

At minimum, an automation should retrieve an investor state,
relevant stock prices and recommendations and output the actions
to be taken.

Ideally, an automation would run as a daily cron job and
actually place orders automatically through an online broker.
