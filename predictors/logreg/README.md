Company selection
---
While it will be important in the long run to include
a good selection of companies that have done poorly over
the timeframe available, this first attempt concentrates
on very conservative companies that have on the whole
succeeded over our timeframe. High-flyers such as MSFT or WMT
and disasters such as AIG have been excluded. The grouping
here is very solid companies with very low risk of going
under and good promise based on fundamentals (known independently
of data provided to the algorithm).
